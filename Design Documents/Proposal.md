# Project Proposal: Step 2
**Author:** Sam Amara

## Introduction: 

  Technology has become prevalent, all over the world, in many aspects of human life. The travel industry benefited greatly from the widespread use of Internet. From booking transportation to booking accommodation, booking attractions or even ordering food, everything has been made easy to be done online and well in advance. Thus, an increasing number of travelers book their entire trips on the Internet using one of the many Online Travel Agencies (OTAs). There is no shortage of OTAs to help the industry thrive.  However, most of the existing tools focus on the trip rather than the traveler. 
 
 
## Purpose of the Software: 

  Being an avid traveler myself, for my class project, I would like to create a web platform, named Journey, that will focus on the traveler. The purpose of the web platform is to help travelers easily plan for upcoming trips using their past plans and other travelers data. Travelers will enter places they lived in, visited and the ones they would like to visit, then log plans for each. Ultimately, based on users and external data the web platform will suggest the most relevant tools and resources for planning, traveling and sharing.


## Functional Requirements: 

  Journey will be designed using Microsoft technologies. The front-end will be implemented using ASP.NET, and the back-end will use C# to process user data. Storage of user data will be on MS SQL server using T-SQL. The goal is to deploy the application to Azure. Scalability of the application will be considered from inception. 
  
  Journey will include the following features:
  - User Login/Sign up
  - User profile 
    - create listing of places (lived in, visited, wants to visit)
    - settings
  - User home page
  - User trips planning/budgeting
    - Transportation
    - Accommodation
    - Attractions/Activities
    - Restaurants 
  - User photo albums and trip stories
  - User family/friends/followers  


## Literature Review: 

  My literature review started at Google. Google itself entered the online travel industry around 2011 with a hotel finding service and expanded its services to include flights in 2016. In the span of 5 years, Google was able to surpass long time OTA leaders such as Priceline and Expedia [1]. Another notable shift is the increasing use of mobile applications for bookings and during trips. This also lead to an increase in last minute travel. 72% of all mobile bookings made by U.S. travelers happened within a 48-hour window prior to the booking [2]. Thus, travel applications must be mobile friendly to succeed. Finally, social media heavily impacted the industry from connecting travelers to creating new opportunities such as home and ride sharing [3][4]. I will use the best practices in the industry and be aware of the recent shits when designing my application.

## Similar Software: 

  There are many travel web platforms out there. I explored over ten and the closest one to my class project is TravellersPoint.com. The latter was launched in 2012 and counts over 950k users in 2019. It includes most of the features I envisioned for Journey. However, focus on travelers could be further accentuated and budgeting information could be added. The web design could use some modernization as well. I will do my best to differentiate Journey from TravellersPoint and other existing platforms. 


## Project Plan:

  I will use an Agile Methodology while designing and building Journey. The project will be developed over 16 weeks with expected delivery by mid-June 2019. Below is a tentative delivery plan:

- Week 1 & 2: design initial database and user Login/Sign up 
- Week 3 & 4: design user profile and homepage  
- Week 5 & 6: expand database and design trips planning/budgeting
- Week 7 & 8: design user photo albums and trip stories 
- Week 9 & 10: design user family/friends/followers features
- Week 11 & 12: enhance trips planning with external data  
- Week 13 & 14: user acceptance testing
- Week 15 & 16: deploy Journey to Azure


## Conclusion

  The travel industry has no shortage of web and mobile applications to assist travelers in planning trips. As technology continues to evolve and travelers behavior changes, there will always be room for offering new services to make it easier for anyone to plan, travel and share. Through Journey, I hope I will deliver a product focused on travelers which provides the best resources available in one place.
